# treasury_bonds

This is a [Treasury Bonds](https://www.centralbank.go.ke/securities/treasury-bonds/) Rust Smart Contract(Solana Blockchain) built for educational purposes.
Treasury bonds are a secure, medium- to long-term investment that typically offer you interest payments every six months throughout the bondâ€™s maturity.
This Smart Contract provides a marketplace where investors buy and sell treasury bonds.

There are three main types of treasury bonds:
- Fixed coupon Treasury bonds
- Infrastructure bonds
- Zero coupon bonds

Below are some features contained in the program:

- Register treasury bonds
- Register investor
- Buy treasury bonds using USDC token
- Sell treasury bonds and get USDC token
- Create USDC token (*for test purposes)
- Transfer USDC token

## Getting started

In order to run this example program you will need to install Rust and
Solana. Information about installing Rust can be found
[here](https://rustup.rs/) and information about installing Solana can
be found [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

Once you've completed the Solana installation run the following
commands to configure your machine for local deployment:

```
solana config set --url localhost
solana-keygen new
```

These two commands create Solana config files in `~/.config/solana/`
which solana command line tools will read in to determine what cluster
to connect to and what keypair to use.

Having done that run a local Solana validator by executing:

```
solana-test-validator
```

This program must be left running in a separate terminal window.

## Deploying the Solana program

To deploy the Solana program in this repository to the Solana cluster
that you have configured run:

```
anchor build
```

```
anchor deploy
```

## Running the test program

To run the test program you must have already deployed the Solana
program. The test program sends a transaction to the Solana
blockchain asking it to execute the deployed program and reports the
results.

```
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```
